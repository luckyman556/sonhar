<h3>Elevate the Shopping Experience on Your New Website Using the QODE Wishlist for WooCommerce</h3>

<a href="https://qodeinteractive.com/products/plugins/qode-wishlist-for-woocommerce/" target="_blank">QODE Wishlist for WooCommerce</a> plugin lets your visitors create practical lists with products they are interested in purchasing or sharing with anyone they choose.

The <strong>"Add to Wishlist"</strong> button can be fully customized to your liking, and can be shown on <strong>product lists</strong>, product <strong>single pages</strong> and <strong>cart pages</strong>.

The process of adding a product to a wishlist involves just a <strong>single button click</strong>, keeping the user interaction cost low.

You have the option to limit the ability to create wishlists <strong>only to logged-in users</strong>, or you can keep this feature <strong>open to anyone</strong> visiting your website.

Best of all, the <a href="https://qodeinteractive.com/products/plugins/qode-wishlist-for-woocommerce/" target="_blank">QODE Wishlist for WooCommerce</a> plugin is completely optimized for mobile devices too.

<h3>Customize Wishlist Pages to Fit Your Specific Style</h3>

The <a href="https://qodeinteractive.com/products/plugins/qode-wishlist-for-woocommerce/" target="_blank">QODE Wishlist for WooCommerce</a> plugin lets you alter a number of aspects of the Wishlist feature on your website.

You can choose a <strong>behavior type</strong> for the ‘Add to Wishlist’ button for items which are already added to a wishlist, you can choose a <strong>layout style</strong> for the wishlist element (icon, icon with tooltip, text), choose where you wish to <strong>position</strong> the "Add to Wishlist" button inside loops and product pages, customize the "Add to Wishlist" <strong>button appearance</strong> (labels, colors, icon & more), as well as <strong>modify the columns</strong> shown in wishlist tables.

On top of that, you can enable automatic item wishlist <strong>removals</strong> for products added to carts, and you can automatically <strong>redirect users</strong> from wishlist to cart pages once they add a wishlisted product to their cart.

The wishlist pages themselves come in two layouts, <strong>table</strong> and <strong>grid</strong>, and can feature a <strong>sorting switcher</strong>, table <strong>items</strong> (e.g., prices, product variations, stock status etc.), <strong>related products</strong>, total <strong>product amounts</strong> as well as a <strong>share</strong> feature.

Visitors can access their wishlists either from the dropdown or in the side area, with the appearance of each <strong>fully adjustable</strong>.

<h3>Let Users Create Multiple Wishlists</h3>

Furthermore, you can allow your visitors to create <strong>multiple wishlists</strong> which can be either <strong>private</strong>, <strong>public</strong> or visible only to users that obtained a link to them.

Multi wishlist pages can contain item counts, dates of creation and more, and much like standard wishlist pages, there are two layout types to choose from – grid and table.

<h3>Include Superbly Practical Wishlist Product Counts</h3>

One more highly useful functionality this plugin boasts is enabling <strong>wishlist counts</strong> for products in lists and single pages. This shows the total number of times users on your website added a specific item to their personal wishlists.

<h3>Get Analytic Insights in the User Behavior Admin Area</h3>

Another practical feature comes in the form of the <strong>user behavior admin area</strong>, where you can obtain analytic data and <strong>follow conversions</strong> either by user or by product.

Here you’ll find the number of times users added specific products to their wishlists, as well as the number of times a product was purchased, allowing you to monitor the overall interest in specific products.

<h3>Enable Automatic Promotional Email Campaigns</h3>

Last but not least, the <a href="https://qodeinteractive.com/products/plugins/qode-wishlist-for-woocommerce/" traget="_blank">QODE Wishlist for WooCommerce</a> plugin provides you with a number of options related to <strong>promotional email campaigns</strong>.

You can enable and configure automatic <strong>on sale</strong>, <strong>promotional</strong> and <strong>back in stock</strong> emails, and on top of that you also have the option to set up <strong>Ask for Estimate</strong> forms with ease.
